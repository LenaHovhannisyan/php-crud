        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>
            <b>JavaScript </b> is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.[6]
            It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.[7] Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of
            the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it
            is supported by all modern Web browsers without plug-ins.[6] JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class
            functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented,[8] imperative, and functional
            programming styles.[6] It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does
            not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host
            environment in which it is embedded.[7]

            Although there are strong outward similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax,
            and respective standard libraries, the two are distinct languages and differ greatly in their design.
            JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.[9]

            JavaScript is also used in environments that are not Web-based, such as PDF documents, site-specific
            browsers, and desktop widgets. Newer and faster JavaScript virtual machines (VMs) and platforms built upon
            them have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side Web applications. On the client side,
            JavaScript has been traditionally implemented as an interpreted language, but more recent browsers perform
            just-in-time compilation. It is also used in game development, the creation of desktop and mobile
            applications, and server-side network programming with run-time environments such as Node.js.
            In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit of the University of Illinois at
            Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important
            part in expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web. In 1994, a company called Mosaic Communications
            was founded in Mountain View, California and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create
            Mosaic Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The internal codename for the
            company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for "Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA
            Mosaic as the world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was
            released in late 1994. Within four months it had already taken three-quarters of the browser market and
            became the main browser for Internet in the 1990s. The browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator
            in the same year, and the company took the name Netscape Communications to avoid trademark ownership
            problems with the NCSA.

            Netscape Communications realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the founder of
            the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was easy to use by Web designers and part-time
            programmers to assemble components such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in
            the Web page markup. In 1995, the company recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of embedding the Scheme
            programming language into its Netscape Navigator. Before he could get started, Netscape Communications
            collaborated with Sun Microsystems to include its more static programming language, Java, in Netscape
            Navigator, to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web technologies and platforms.[10] Netscape
            Communications then decided that the scripting language would complement Java and should have a similar
            syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of
            JavaScript against competing proposals, Netscape needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, in May 1995.

            Although it was developed under the name Mocha, the language was officially called LiveScript when it first
            shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed JavaScript[11] when
            it was deployed in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 in December.
